      <p>
        When tapping a text input, the webview will adjust
        so the input is viewable when the keyboard is up.
        However, as a single page webapp, this can move the
        fixed headers/footers out of the viewable area, or the input
        will get covered up by the keyboard. A native
        appâ€™s header/footer would not adjust or have keyboard cover the input.

        Current Results:

      <ul>
        <li>Android Chrome: Input gets covered. FWIW, this is preferred rather than
          completely adjusting the entire webpage. However, it'd still be nice
          to have the input scroll to a viewable location after the keyboard comes up.</li>
        <li>iOS 9.3.2 / Chrome and Safari: Header moved out of view.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Scroll to the bottom of this page and tap the input.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because it's on the bottom of the page, when the keyboard
        comes up it'll cover the input, so either the browser adjusts
        the entire webpage, or the input gets covered up. Can it scroll
        the scollable containing element instead?
