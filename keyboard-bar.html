    Keyboard Accessory Bar

        Problem: A clear signal that a webapp is not a native app
        is the keyboard accessory bar, or really just having is showing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Case: A chat app's page would only have 1 text input
        in the footer, and should float directly above the
        keyboard when showing. However, the next/done/arrow
        buttons take away from the UX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proposal: An api to control and/or remove the virtual
        keyboard's accessory bar, similar to native Android or iOS. Bascially,
        somehow have the ability to create a chat input like Slack's
        or Twitter's native app.
