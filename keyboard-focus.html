    Programmatically Bring Up Keyboard
  </header>

        Problem: On desktop you can run element.focus() and the
        input receives focus. However, on mobile, element.focus()
        must come from a touch event for the virtual keyboard to
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proposal: Allow the keyboard to programmatically appear,
        without requiring to come from without a touch event's
        callstack.
      </p>

      <p>
        Current Results:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Android: Works, but does not scroll the input into a viewable area.</li>
        <li>iOS 9.3.2 / Chrome and Safari: Does not focus or bring up the keyboard.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Tapping the input below will bring up the keyboard because
        it came from the user's touch event.
      </p>

      <p>
        <input id="input" value="Tap to bring up keyboard">
      </p>

      <p>
        However, programmatically bringing up the keyboard is a
        challenge. For example, the button below calls focus
        on the input from within a setTimeout, which will fire
        the focus() outside of the touch event's' callstack.
        This does not work, but shows how it's difficult to manage
        the keyboard through only input focusing/blurring.
      </p>

      <p>
        <button onclick="btnClick()">Focus input button</button>
        <script>
          function btnClick() {
            setTimeout(function(){
              document.getElementById('input').focus();
            });
          }
        </script>
      </p>
